        q: "How is this different from regular traction or an inversion table?",
        a: "Regular traction pulls steadily, which causes the muscles to guard against the pull. Modern decompression uses a computer-controlled pull-and-release pattern that bypasses the guarding reflex and produces actual negative pressure inside the disc. Inversion tables can help mild cases but can't reliably deliver the targeted, segmental pull that decompression does.",
