                  Hi, I am Jess Biggs. I have over 25 years of experience and am
                  deeply passionate about guiding people toward a healthier,

                  In my youth, my father was seriously burned twice in a 3-year
                  period that necessitated that I, along with my mother and 2
                  sisters, became his intimate caretakers. This experience put me
                  on a path and a career of wanting to care for and relieve the
                  suffering of those in pain.

                  solutions to help those working toward better spinal health
